# Sentiment Analyzer
This is a sentiment analyzer project that predicts the sentiment of a text review. It uses a support vector machine (SVM) model that is trained on a dataset of reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels.

# Getting Started
To run the sentiment analyzer, you first need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the sentiment analyzer by running the following command:

python predict_sentiment.py
This will launch the sentiment analyzer in your terminal. You can then enter a text review and the sentiment analyzer will predict the sentiment of the review.

# Usage
You can also use the sentiment analyzer as a web application. To do this, you need to run the following command:

python app.py
This will launch a web application that you can access by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:5000/. You can then enter a text review and the sentiment analyzer will predict the sentiment of the review.
